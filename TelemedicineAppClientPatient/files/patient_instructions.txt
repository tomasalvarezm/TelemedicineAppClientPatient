PATIENT’S INSTRUCTIONS:

If it’s the first time you access the application, you will need to register as a new patient clicking 
in the “REGISTER” button. Then, a new screen will appear, where you will have to enter both, your 
personal and contact information. 

Once you are registered, you will be able to log in by typing your ID.
 
Then, you will access a new screen in which you can conduct the following action:

- Modify my symptoms:

  - Select the medication you are taking at the moment. 
  - Choose symptoms: Select all the different symptoms or side effects that you are experiencing 
    while taking such medication.
 
- Upload signal:

    When selecting this option, you will access a new screen where you can start and stop the
    signal recording. First, place the electrodes (two on the muscular belly of the thumb and
    the black one on the triceps). Then, start your Bitalino device and start recording the
    signal by clicking in the “START” button. Once the time is over, press the “STOP” button.
    Finally, click on send to send the signal to your doctor. 

After completing all this information, you can exit the application safely.
